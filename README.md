# Skeduler Chatbot

This repository contains the code for the Skeduler Chatbot, a document-based chatbot that helps users with various queries related to booking appointments, finding locations, and more. The chatbot uses a combination of PDF document parsing, vector database search, and natural language processing to provide relevant information to users.

## Features

- **PDF Document Parsing**: Extracts text from a PDF file to build a knowledge base.
- **Vector Database**: Uses SentenceTransformers and FAISS to create a searchable vector database of the document content.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Utilizes the HuggingFace InferenceClient to generate responses based on user queries and the context provided by the PDF documents.
- **Gradio Interface**: Provides an easy-to-use web interface for interacting with the chatbot.



## Usage

1. Place your PDF document (`skeduler_knowledge_base.pdf`) in the project directory.

2. Run the chatbot:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided by Gradio to interact with the chatbot.
